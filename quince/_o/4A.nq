The school was constructed in 1835 and is recorded by the tithe survey of Clifton made in 1844 (BRO EP/A/32/12). It was a large two-storey structure with a hipped roof and occupied a footprint measuring 29 metres east-west by 13 metres north to south on an apparently specially constructed terrace. The main, south-facing, elevation was of nine bays and had tall, narrow windows to both floors, those of the first-floor having segmental-headed arches. The side east-facing, elevation had three bays. Plans in Bristol Record Office (BRO 229389(6 & 7)) indicate that the ground-floor was largely occupied by a single teaching space. At the western end of the building were two smaller rooms and a lodge projected from the building at ground floor. The stairs to the first-floor were at the south-eastern corner of the building. The first-floor was largely occupied by the girls school with a smaller teaching area divided off by partitions at the head of the stair.\r\nBy 1883 an extension had been added to the eastern end of the building. This was intended as an Infants School and the Girls school was later also moved into the building. It measured 20 metres from east to west by 10 metres north-south and was a single-storey structure with a pitched roof and basement. The side, south-facing, elevation was of five bays with tall windows with segmental-headed arches and ashlar dressings. Immediately beneath the windows there was a projecting moulded freestone ashlar string course, with a second around 0.5 metres below this. The parapets at the east and west ends of the roof also had ashlar dressings. A single-storey block linking the two school buildings contained the latrines.\r\nThe school building survived into the twentieth-century and were damaged by bombing in the early 1940s. The structure remained in ruins throughout the 1950s and the site was subsequently redeveloped. However, the gymnasium, apparently dating to the first two decades of the twentieth century, survives as do elements of the main school building in the succeeding structure (Parry, 2001)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

The site was created by the infilling of Aldsworth's Dock in the mid-seventeenth century and a building is recorded on the site by Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol.\r\nThe original form of the building is unknown but it appears to have been refronted in the late-eighteenth or early-nineteenth century. It was by then a three-storey rendered building of four bays with rusticated ashlar quoins and a hipped pantile roof. The main, north-facing, elevation in Thunderbolt Street consisted of a shopfront with the entrance towards the eastern side. There were three large shop windows on either side of the entrance at ground-floor level, with a third at the west end. A string course divided the ground from the first floor and the fenestration above comprised four tall six over nine pane sash window. The third floor was also marked by a string course with four smaller six over six pane sashes. The side, west-facing, elevation in Broad Quay had three entrance doorways, one blocked at the north end of the elevation with a pedimented canopy, another with a recessed door set in an opening with a plain segmental-arch at the centre. There was a similar doorway at the south end of the elevation and immediately to its north there was a small cellar light. Between these doorways, on both the north and south side of the central door, there was a large shop window. A string course divided the ground from the first floor and at first-floor level the fenestration consisted of tall nine over nine pane sash windows, with two in the south half of the elevation and a single sash in the north half. There was a smaller window between the large sashes, within its head well above the others, possibly lighting a stair. At first floor there were two smaller single nine over nine pane sashes. The eaves of the roof were marked by dentils which continued around the fa�ade of No.79 Broad Quay (BUAD 1395M). There was a small brick chimneystack in the north elevation and a larger stack, the base of which was of stone rubble and the upper part brick, projecting from the party wall with No.79 Broad Quay.\r\nThe Goad fire insurance plan of January 1887 records the building as a chandlers dealing in ships stores with a sail loft. By the 1890s it was owned by Tratman Brothers who advertised themselves as canvas and rope merchants, a general ship stores and sail lofts on the front of the building (Winstone, 1960 pls.62-63). The building was apparently demolished soon after the closure of Alderskey Lane in 1900 (Pritchard, 1904 128-129) and the site was subsequently redeveloped for the Co-operative Wholesale building."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

David Lloyd-George addressed a meting in the hall during the Second Boer War. \r\nRalph Pringle leased the building and converted it into a 580-seat cinema. This opened on 19 October 1909 (Winstone 1972, 8) and Vestry Hall was Ralph Pringle's second cinema in Bristol after the Bedminster Town Hall Cinema (Anderson 1983, 16). A licence for cinematograph entertainment, music and dancing had been obtained by 1920. In 1921 the lease was taken over by Mr A. B. Atkinson who installed an RCA sound system. The hall remained in use as a cinema until 1954. The building was subsequently converted to industrial use.\r\nThe building is extant. A survey of the building was carried out by David Etheridge of Avon Archaeological Unit in 2007 (BHER 4428) (Etheridge, 2008)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

The building was a gabled of three storeys and attic with a pantile roof lying on the north side of Castle Street. It was almost certainly constructed as part of the redevelopment of the site of Bristol Castle after its demolition in the late 1650s, probably in 1664.\r\nThe building was painted by T. L. S. Rowbotham in 1829 (BUAD 1832; BRSMG Mb6398) when the occupier was \"I. Walsh & Co Irish Linen Warehouse.\" The ground floor of the main elevation was a shopfront with the main door slightly to the west of the centre of the elevation. The first- and second-floor fenestration comprised a canted bay, with a large central sash and small sashes on each side. On either side of the bay there was pargetting or moulded plasterwork. The pargetting on either side of the bay at first floor had central elliptical panels, the western containing the letters \"SD\" and the eastern the date \"1664\". The plasterwork was very similar in style to that of No.8, suggesting that the work on the two buildings was executed at the same time and for the same owners. The divisions between first and second-floor and between second-floor and attic level were marked by moulded string courses, each extending the full-width of the elevation. The attic was lit by a three-light casement at the centre of the gable and there was a chimney stack on the east side of the roof.\r\nThe building survived into the early twentieth century. Its site now lies in Castle Park on the east side of the path from Broad Weir past the end of St. Peter's Church."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
