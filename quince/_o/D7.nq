The Dean and Chapter leased a plot at the south-east corner of the square to James Greene in 1611 (BRO DC/E/40/28/1) and the building was constructed on this plot in the seventeenth century. It was a single-bay jettied, gabled house of three storeys and the front (north-facing) and side (west-facing) elevations of the building were rendered. The ground floor contained a central entrance doorway and the jetty above was supported on four equally-spaced columns. The ground floor was divided from first floor by a narrow full-width pentice. The fenestration at first floor comprised a single five- by three-pane timber casement window. On the east side of the building there was a projecting element with a hipped pantile roof which extended only up to second floor. This was apparently square and was in front of the fa�ade of the two-storey building attached to the east side. The function of this projecting element is unclear and it was divided from the rest of the fa�ade by a timber pilaster, although it would appear to have been part of the original design of the building. The pediment dividing first- from second-floor did not extend across the full-width of the main elevation at this level, terminating at the eaves of the hipped element of the roof. The second floor fenestration was a wide five- by two-pane casement. There was no window in the attic gable. The roof was pantiled with a three-flue brick stack in the ridge of the roof at the rear of the building. On the west side of the building there was a gateway of coursed squared rubble stone, the main, north-facing,elevation was rendered with what appear to have been ashlar facings. This led to a path around the east and south sides of a walled garden belonging to the building to the west.\r\nBy 1825 the building had become the Black Horse public house. The building was demolished not long after 1890 along with the other structures on the south side of College Square. The site of the building now lies mainly beneath Anchor Road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

There was an ornately carved stone chimney-piece (BUAD 1002A) reported to be of Ham Hill stone.

Pritchard also noted that the ground-floor had been subject to much alteration, although a short element of the original staircase survived \"on the upper floor\".\r\nThe building was demolished, along with No.45 St. Mary-le-Port Street on it western side, between April and August 1920, to make way for the construction of new premises for Messrs.

It remained in the hands of the family until c1823 when it was taken over by Charles Hopkins. Hopkins had been declared bankrupt by 1843. In 1846 the mill became the property of Thomas Jones junior. Jones died in 1848 and the mill was subsequently leased to Josiah Bell, who ran it until the early twentieth century. The Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucester Sheet LXXII.06) published in 1882 names the mill as Stapleton Mill and indicates that it was a flour mill at that date but by 1902 the mill was disused.\r\nThe mill was a single storey structure with an undershot wheel, boiler and chimney. In 1899 the machinery comprised \"a 12 Horse-Power Water Wheel, three pairs of stones, Oat, Malt and Bean crusher and Dressing Mill\" (quoted in Ward 1969, 24).

The building was a cross-gabled, possibly jettied, house of two storeys and attic with a 1-window range. It was of probable seventeenth-century date. The footprint of the building measured by 8.5 metres from north-west to south-east by 5 metres wide. The main elevation faced west on to Haymarket and in most photographs of the building the ground-floor is obscured by foliage and its form is therefore unknown at present. However, it was presumably occupied by a shop. The fenestration at first floor and attic level comprised a single sash and above the first-floor window there was a large painted signboard extending across the full-width of the building. The roof was pantiled. There was a passageway leading to a rear yard along the north side of the building.\r\nThe building was demolished in 1953 or 1954. Its site now lies mainly beneath the House of Fraser department store and partly beneath the footway on the north side of the building."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
