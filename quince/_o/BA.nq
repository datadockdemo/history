The building was constructed in 1885 to a design by Robert Carwen. It is a two-storey, five-bay structure of Brandon Hill Grit with limestone ashlar dressings. The structure is in a Tudor Gothic Revival style with perpendicular window and door openings. The central bay comprises a large, full-height, ashlar porch with octagonal buttresses. The main entrance is an arched double doorway and there is a three-light oriel window with a moulded base and a crenellated parapet above. The bays at either end of the building are gables and have projecting bay windows with canted sides at ground floor. The roof is covered with clay tiles and there is a large chimneystack to the northern ans southern ends of the roof. The original design included an ornate bellcote with crocketed finials at the centre of the roof, but this has been removed. Internally the building has a decorated entrance hall.\r\nNew wards designed by the architectural practice Oatley and Lawrence (BRO Building Plan Book 48 fo.12) were added to the rear of the building in 1905.\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/10/284)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

<http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/resource/monument_record_no/472M> <https://schema.org/description> "Great Hall of Bristol Castle, located within the inner ward of Bristol Castle, at the eastern end of Castle Park.. The building was constructed in the thirteenth century with additions in the fourteenth century. Relatively little is currently known about the form of the Great Hall as a whole. The surviving Vaulted Chambers, probably part of the entrance to the building, is constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble with limestone ashlar detailing and consists of two adjoining rectangular chambers with quadripartite ribbed vaults, though the ribs of the two cells have different profiles, indicating that they do not belong to the same phase of construction. The structure appears to have been described by William Worcester in the early 1480s who notes it was 10 yards long, \"with an arched vault above the entrance of the great hall\" (Neale 2000, 238-239).\r\nThe building was one of the elements of Bristol Castle which survived its demolition in 1657-1658. It was incorporated into a new large house on the east side of Tower Street which is recorded by James Millerd's 1673 plan of Bristol. By the 1820s the building was owned by the Feoffees of the Baptist Society and let to a Mr. Gould (Braikenridge Notes A.29+ and A.29++). Samuel Seyer published a plan and view of the interior (Seyer 1821, 384-386) when the surviving medieval elements were largely the same as the currently existing plan. The interior of the building was recorded in three watercolour drawings by Hugh O'Neill in 1821 (BRSMG M2731 to M2733) and a seventeenth-century stair with carved newels and balusters and pendant newels at first floor survived beyond the north end of the building, a stair which is likely to have dated to the original conversion of the building into a house in the late 1650s or early 1660s. A drawing of the following year by Samuel Jackson (BRSMG M2734) recorded the Tower Street elevation, including a four-centred arched entrance containing a panelled door dating to the seventeenth-century and a pair of stepped buttresses. Gould removed the stepped buttresses on 21 October 1822 and the work was drawn in progress by Jackson (BRSMG M2735). By the late-nineteenth century the northern half of the building had been subdivided by the insertion of a stud partition. The seventeenth century stair was also extant at this date but was subsequently removed. By 1920 the building formed of No.21 Tower Street, then Sealey Brothers confectionery shop. Sealey Brothers inserted a new suspended floor in the southern half of the building, possibly after removal of a vaulted undercroft. The shop was let to Boots the Chemist in the 1930s which rebuilt the fa�ade, and also appears to have been responsible for breaking through the eastern bays. The vaults were scheduled in 1936-37. The shop was bombed in November 1940 (Warne 1943, 7) and the building gutted. The medieval vaulted arches survived largely intact, though the limestone apparently suffered some heat damage from the associated fire. Some emergency repairs were made to stabilise the structure. The building was subject to Compulsory Purchase by the Bristol Corporation in 1951 but seems to have remained empty until the building was restored in 1974 by the architect Alan Rome (who made an initial measured survey of the building in 1970 (BUAD 3187)). As part of the work the floor was removed and relaid in concrete with an underfloor heating system. An extension was built at the north end of the building in the early 1980s, its site being archaeologically excavated in advance (BUAD 3096), and remedial works were also undertaken in 1993-1994 by the architect John Winstone.\r\nThe building is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Monument no. AV116) and has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/40/222)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
