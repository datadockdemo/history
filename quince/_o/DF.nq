The abbey church was apparently the second abbey church, and it has been suggested that it was a larger church than the original (which may have been located on the site of the church of St. Augustine the Less) and was built as part of a repositioning of the abbey in the mid-twelfth century. The church was dedicated in 1170.\r\nFragments of the church remain, in particular the transepts of the present cathedral are known to rest on the lower part of those of the 1170 church. The plan of the church is unknown but the area of the nave of the cathedral was cleared of old walls when it was rebuilt in the nineteenth-century and the recovery of the full plan of the 1170 church may therefore be difficult."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

The church was probably founded before 1066, although the exact date is unknown, and it is commonly assumed, on the basis of the placename evidence, to have an origin as a minster church. It may perhaps also have been the centre of a large estate (Costen 1992, 71). The church lay at the northern boundary of the diocese of Salisbury (and later Bath and Wells) and consequently was the mother church to Abbots Leigh and to St. Mary Redcliffe and St. Thomas the Martyr in Redcliffe.\r\nSt. John is reported, along with other buildings in Bedminster, to have been burnt by Prince Rupert's troops as they retreated from Bristol in 1645. In January 1651/2 the parish entered a plea at the Quarter Sessions for assistance in raising the estimated �3500 pounds which repair of the church would cost (SMR 20351; Bates Harbin 1912, 202). The rebuilt church is recorded in watercolours in the Braikenridge Collection, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery and in a watercolour executed by John Chessell Buckler in 1827 in The Piggott Collection. It was also described in February 1849 by Sir Stephen Glynne (SMR 882) as a \"plain church, comprising a nave with north aisle, chancel, west tower and north porch\" which had Early English, Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic features (McGarvie 1994, 34-35).\r\nSt. John was demolished again in 1853 to allow the building of a new church. This was designed by John Norton and was completed in 1855 (Dawson 1981, 21).\r\nThe church was gutted as a result of bombing in 1941. The rebuilding was delayed and a decision not to rebuild the church was taken in 1954. The remains of the church were cleared in 1966 and Bristol City Council bought the churchyard in 1973 (Crossley-Evans 2000, 80).\r\nThe churchyard was surveyed in 1980 by the Action Group for Bristol Archaeology in advance of clearance of the memorials for the creation of a public open space from the cemetery (Dawson in Thomas 1979), with additional information being recorded subsequently by Williams (1981). The state of the archaeological stratification on the site is unknown but deposits of high quality are very likely to survive. Dawson (1981) suggested that the site was worthy of designation as a Scheduled Ancient Monument."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

The mission church was constructed in the early twentieth century, some time after 1904. It was first recorded by the Ordnance Survey third edition 1:2500-scale plan (Somerset Sheet VI.08) published in 1916. St. Cuthbert's Church (SMR22394) was built on Sandringham Road to replace it as as a parish church in 1931-32. The mission church was subsequently demolished and the site was redeveloped for housing."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

The nursery was in existence by the 1880s and is recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500-scale Town Plan (Bristol Sheet LXXI.16.5) surveyed in 1881. The street directory for 1883 record it as belonging to Jesse Prestidge, seedsman and florist. The nursery was a walled, essentially rectangular site with the main vehicular entrance on Bath Buildings. The site had a 42-metre frontage on Cheltenham Road and was 37 metres wide, covering an area of approximately 1490 square metres. A large building at the south-west corner of the site appears to have been residential, and there were ten greenhouses towards the centre of the site.\r\nThe western part of the site was removed to enable the widening of Cheltenham Road and the remainder of the site was subsequently redeveloped."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

<http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/resource/monument_record_no/603M> <https://schema.org/description> "Broad Plain Soap and Candle Works. The Broad Plain factory was established in 1783 by the Fripp family and it was run by Samuel Fripp & Co. in the early nineteenth century. The 1828 map of Bristol surveyed by Plumley and Ashmead records the factory lying to the south of Straight Street and reached by an (extant) hauling way off Broad Plain. In 1841 the business merged with the soapmakers T. Thomas & C. J. Thomas (established in 1824 in Red Lion Yard, off Redcliff Street (Sommerville, 1991 31)) to become Thomas, Fripp & Thomas.\r\nThe business expanded and laid emphasis on research into improvements in the quality of the products and of production methods, including the taking out of a patent on a process to recover glycerine in 1878 (Diaper, 1987 226). There was also considerable rebuilding in the early 1880s. The old pan building was seriously damaged by fire in March 1902. The works was taken over by Lever Brothers in 1914 and continued to operate as a soap factory until its closure in 1954.\r\nMany of the buildings are listed including the warehouse (Grade II) and factory on either side of Straight Street (Grade II). The former was built in 1865 to a design by W. B. Gingell and refronted in 1884 with its current facade while the latter dated to 1841-43, with its upper floors being rebuilt in 1882. The majority of the old pan building survives as does a shed adjoining the southern wall of that building and accessible from the car park on Old Bread Street. These are, however, in a poor state of repair."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
