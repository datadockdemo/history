The building was a three-store, single-bay rendered house was probably constructed of stone rubble. The original form of the building is uncertain, although it was probably gabled. There was a chimney stack on the north side of the roof.\r\nThe fa�ade was probably altered in the eighteenth or early nineteenth century, when the windows were altered to sashes. The door and parapet may have been added at the same time. The fa�ade was symmetrical to that of No.55 St. Michael's Hill next door. The main entrance door was on the south side of the elevation and was contained within an arch, possibly of ashlar limestone. The door itself was wooden and had a fan light above it. There was a single sash window on each floor, although the opening for the second storey window was smaller that the others.\r\nThe first occupant of the house to be recorded by the ratebooks was Daniel Pill in 1705, although the entry in the ratebook comments that \"a house yt is building\" (Leech 2000, 65).

<http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/resource/monument_record_no/1767M> <https://schema.org/description> "Westbury College, Westbury-on-Trym. A minster is thought to have stood on the site by the early eighth century. In c963AD a Benedictine monastery was established at the site by Oswald (Bishop of Worcester, 961-992). He appointed a monk named Germanus from the abbey of Fleury at Saint-Beno�t-sur-Loire (where Oswald had spent a period earlier in his career) as prior and Westbury became a focus of a Benedictine revival in the region (Graham 1907, 107). In 968-970 the monastery was suppressed and the monks transferred to the Ramsey abbey in northern Cambridgeshire. The monastery was refounded by Bishop Wulfstan (1062-1096) as a cell of Worcester in about 1086. In 1093 it was endowed with lands in Westbury itself, Henbury, Charlton and elsewhere in Gloucesterhshire. The monastery was again suppressed, this time by Bishop Samson (1096-1113) and a college of secular canons was established. In 1286 this was enlarged from five to fourteen canonries by Bishop Giffard (1286-1301) in an attempt to have the churches within his patronage made prebendal to Westbury (Hoskin 2003, 439). Westbury College was reconstituted by Bishop Carpenter (1443-1476) with a grammar school and almshouse. The grammar school was founded in 1463 and the master was funded through the revenues of the Clifton parish church, St. Andrew. The first master was Roger Fabell and along with all of the subsequent masters he held the post together with another benefice. Carpenter also funded exhibitions for six scholars at Oriel College, Oxford and the dean of had the right to nominate at least one exhibitioner (Orme 1976, 182-184). Edward IV granted a number of manors and other privileges to Westbury in the 1460s (Graham 1907, 108). In 1535 the college comprised the Dean, the Sub-Dean, five prebendaries, Bishop Carpenter's chaplain, eight fellows, four clerks, six aged priests, twelve choristers and a schoolmaster (Graham 1907, 108).\r\nThe College was surrendered to the Crown in February 1544, the surrender document being signed by the Dean, John Barlo[w], the Sub-Dean John Lawrence and John Kerell and Thomas Barlo[w], prebendaries (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 65). This also resulted in the loss of the grammar school. The College site and its property holdings were purchased by Sir Ralph Sadleir in March 1544 (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 175-176).\r\nDuring the Royalist attack on Bristol in July 1643 Prince Rupert was quartered at the College (Firth 1925, 183) and it was apparently one of the buildings fired by Royalist troops as the New Model Army arrived to attack Bristol in 1645. The College building was drawn by James Stewart in September 1747.\r\nArchaeological excavation in 1968 directed by M. W. Ponsford of Bristol City Museum, revealed a boundary wall and stone jetty adjoining the River Trym, interpreted as a possible part of the college of 1194. Also recorded were buildings dating from the thirteenth- to the fifteenth-centuries with an L-shaped moat around the site. The oldest surviving elements of the Westbury College building include a four-storey gate tower and corner turrets, a spiral stair leading to the bell chamber.\r\nThe building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building Number 901-1/26/2056)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

The creation of a public park in St. George was suggested in 1890, and by 1894 the Urban District Council had acquired Fire Engine Farm as a site. Later a parcel of land was bought from Whitehall Colliery. There was an informal opening on 18 July 1894 after which designs for the layout of the park were invited. The winning design was that submitted by T. Lawrence Lewis. This had as its main feature a lake around which paths were set, with straight walks focusing on a central bandstand. Originally this was planted with Chestnut trees but these failed to establish themselves and within a few years were replaced with London Planes. A wrought iron fence 5 feet 6 inches high surrounded the park. In 1897 the Bristol Corporation took over the park and completed the laying out, which was apparently progressing slowly because of financial restrictions. The bowling green was completed in 1907-08. A cannon was positioned immediately inside the main entrance. The cannon was probably removed during the Second World War and the bandstand in 1958 (Lambert 2000, 54-60)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

The hospital was founded by Maurice de Gaunt sometime before his death in 1230, with a brief to feed one hundred poor people daily. The hospital was initially administered by St. Augustine's Abbey, but was made a separate foundation by Robert de Gurnay, Maurice de Gaunt's nephew and heir, in 1232 (Ross 1959, 5). The hospital was Benedictine and the charter of 1232 specified that the community comprised the master, four chaplains and eight clerks.\r\nThe precinct extended between College Green along the line of modern Unity Street, to Pipe Lane where the corner of the boundary was marked by two plaques bearing winged lions and a small niche (presumably for a figure of the Virgin or other statue) on the exterior walls of No.9 Pipe Lane. The hospital complex consisted of a church (BUAD 93M) with a cloister on its north side. The hospital was involved in a series of disputes with St. Augustine's Abbey from the early-thirteenth century. These involved use of College Green  on which the hospital had grazed its animals and buried some of its dead (Ross 1959, 7-10). In 1491 the Abbey of St. Augustine claimed that the hospital fell within its manorial jurisdiction, beginning another long dispute in which the Bristol authorities became involved.\r\nIn 1534 the hospital community had five members. Four brothers and the master, John Colman, were still present at the time of the hospital's dissolution on 9th December 1539. The church plate was sent to London in February 1540 and the Hospital and its lands were acquired by the Bristol Corporation in May 1541."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

The building a late seventeenth-century  gabled house of three-storeys and attic and is of rendered stone rubble. The main, north-east facing, elevation is of six bays. The main entrance doorway is a the centre of the elevation and is surrounded by a rusticated ashlar moulding with an open-base pediment above. There is a pair of sash windows at either end of the elevation and six sashes at first floor. The three sashes at second floor are beneath the gables but those at the northern and southern ends of the elevation are not set exactly between the sashes below. The three gable ends are blind. The building is one room deep in plan and has a projecting stair at the rear. There is a chimney stack at the north and the south end of the roof.\r\nThe house was built between 1679 and 1689, apparently for Marmaduke Bowdler and was purchased from him in 1692 by Lady Phillipa Gore and occupied by her and Joseph Knight Esq., according to the ratebooks, until 1706. The building was occupied by Richard Haynes Esq. from 1709 and by Edward Bisdy (or Bisdee) and his widow from 1722 until the mid-1760s. From 1765 until 1773 Charles Horwood lived there (Leech, 2000 48-49).\r\nThe house is now in the ownership of the University of Bristol. It has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-/4/275)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

<http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/resource/monument_record_no/694M> <https://schema.org/description> "The open space known as College Green. The land belonged to St. Augustine's Abbey and was used as the cemetery for the abbey according to documents of the thirteenth-century. It was the subject of disputes between the abbey and the neighbouring Hospital of St. Mark in the thirteenth- and fifteenth-centuries which were over access and grazing. The disputes were only settled by the intervention of the Bishop of Worcester. An open-air pulpit (BUAD 510M) was located in the centre of the green and the chapel of St. Jordan (BUAD 1058M) was located towards the abbey.\r\nThe green was transferred to the ownership of the Dean and Chapter after the dissolution. The 1880s Ordnance Survey map shows avenues running away from the centre of the green. A replica of the High Cross was erected at the end of the nineteenth-century. Deanery Road was pushed in front of the cathedral in the late nineteenth-century, dividing it from the green. Part of the area on the northern sides were destroyed by the construction of the new Council House through the 1930s and during the Second World War two air-raid shelters were dug across its centre. In the 1950s the green was landscaped: the trees around its edge were removed and the level of the ground apparently lowered. A refurbishment scheme removed Deanery Road and landscaped the area around the Queen Victoria statue in the early 1990s."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
