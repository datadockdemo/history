The main entrance is on the west side of the building and is reached by a set of four stone steps shaerd with No.8. On the east side of the doorway there is a pair of five by four pane sash windows. A pantiled pentice roof which runs the full width of Nos.7 and 8 divides the ground from the first floor. The fenestration at first floor consists of a single, central canted bay. A similar pentice divides the first and second, and the second and attic storeys, again with a canted bay at second floor. Above the small attic window there is a pantiled pentice across its width. The building was partly refenestrated in the eighteenth-century.\r\nRestoration between 1967 and 1976, when it and No.8 formed the offices of Moxley, Jenner and Partners, architects, revealed the reuse of ship's timbers as structural elements within the building.

<http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/resource/monument_record_no/337M> <https://schema.org/description> "The Exchange, Corn Street. Consideration of the need for a new gathering place for the city's merchants to replace the existing Tolzey began in 1717. An Act of Parliament was obtained in early 1722 permitting construction of the Exchange. William Halfpenny (the professional name used by Michael Hoare) submitted several designs for the building but John Wood the Elder was ultimately selected to produce the design. The foundation stone was laid by the Lord Mayor in March 1741 and the building completed in 1743. The decorative carving was undertaken by Thomas Paty. The opening on 21st September 1743 was attended by the Mayor (Sir Abraham Elton) and Aldermen.\r\nThe Corn Street elevation is of limestone ashlar, with lateral stacks, a hipped slate and leaded roof. It has a central square courtyard with rooms ranged around it. The principal elevation is symmetrical with a pedimented 3-window centre set forward, a rusticated ground floor, pedestal course to four Corinthian columns to the centre and pilasters to the sides. The main entrance in the Corn Street facade is a semi-circular arched doorway with rusticated reveals and heavy arched double doors with studs and cast-iron lion-head knockers. The ground-floor windows have incised voussoirs, and the first-floor windows Corinthian pilaster jambs with entablature and pediments. They are alternately triangular and segmental, with a central Venetian window, and square second-floor windows. Below the frieze is a band of well-detailed swag and festoon to human and animal heads symbolising trade, and a Royal Coat of Arms in the tympanum. The majority of the original fabric is Pennant sandstone rubble.\r\nWood's design included a coffee house and a tavern at the north-east and north-west corners of the building, respectively. Along the east and west sides of the building there were individual houses, each of which consisted of a single room on each floor with a cellar, a kitchen at semi-basement level and other accommodation above, including a counting house. Two of the kitchens on the eastern side of the building retain many of their fittings as does one of the counting houses on the west side.\r\nThere have been significant campaigns of alteration to the building throughout its life. The floors of the cellars in the centre of the building were lowered c.1811-1813 when the Exchange became the Corn Exchange. Another major scheme was carried through in 1872 by the architect E. M. Barry. The central courtyard was roofed and a new suite of offices was created on the first floor, above the colonnades around the court. There were further changes after the Second World War. The clock tower over the south range was removed and the four floors of the coffee house and the main entrance were rebuilt internally. The current roof over the central courtyard dates to 1949.\r\nWood published a short description of the building and an account of its building (Wood, 1745) and a study of its building was made by Priest in 1980. The most complete examination, however, has been a full measured survey and interpretation made in 1998 by Dr. Roger Leech (BUAD 3374) which identified the extent of the surviving original fabric and phased the various alterations (Leech, 1998). The original inner gates to The Exchange are currently located in the Industrial Museum.\r\nThe building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/11/578)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

A town gate which stood at the top of St. John's Steep. A minor gate, it was possibly a later addition to the defensive line. The gate itself consisted of a plain segmental arch to the outer, or north, side and was accompanied, west, by a small turret or barbette, the Dove Tower [390M]. The arch was constructed of stone rubble, with the segmental arch on the southern, inside, face of moulded freestone while on the outside removal of the render revealed a plain stone arch with voussoirs, apparently of Pennand sandstone above. By the early nineteenth century there was a 2-storey house with mansard roof built above the arch. O'Neill's drawings show the gate to be about twice the width of the 6/6 pane sashes in the house above. \r\nSeyer (1821, 266-267) noted that the town wall was about 10 feet thick at this point. In 1888 it was noted that the gate was \"so nearly covered with modern buildings that only a fragment of the gate itself is visible.\" The gate and house were removed in March 1911. The demolition was photographed at successive stages by the local photographer Fred Little and observed by John Pritchard; a number of finds were recovered."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

The central three bays were within a three-sided apse projecting towards Trenchard Street, which had crenellations along the roof line. A string line ran across the full width of the building at the height of the top of the apse. Two crenellated pillars projected from string line at the ends of the facade. In the centre of the pediment was a small single light with a four-centred arch and a hood-mould above.

The girls' school was founded by John Elbridge, and he had apparently overseen the construction of a house and schoolroom, with an associated garden, before his death in February 1739. In his will he left �3,000 in trust \"for the better establishment\" of the school (Manchee 1831, 225-226). Elbridge leased the land parcel within which the school was constructed, Joachim's Close, from the Dean and Chapter of Bristol Cathedral until his death, and the land was presumably part of the endowment he bequeathed for the purpose of founding the school (Leech 2000, 47).\r\nThe school had certainly been constructed by 1747 when it was recorded in a drawing by James Stewart (BUAD 2766). The building was orientated from north-east to south-west, parallel with Fort Lane, and measured approximately 56 feet (17.1 metres) along the Fort Lane frontage by 15 feet (4.6 metres) wide. It was a single-storey six-bay building with a hipped roof. The fenestration of the south-east facing elevation comprised six large sashes and the side, south-west facing, elevation had a single sash at its centre. A low parapet surrounded the roof. The garden was to the north of the building. In the early-nineteenth century the school was described as consisting of \"a dwelling, with several convenient apartments, now occupied by the mistress of the school, with a school-room adjoining, though not under the same roof, and is capable of accommodating one hundred children\" (Manchee 1831, 226). It was managed by the vicar of St. Michael's and the 24 girls educated were taught \"reading, writing, summing, and plain needle-work, and they are otherwise employed so as to fit them for the business of servants. They are also instructed in the elements of christian [sic] duty and belief\" (Manchee 1831, 226).\r\nThe use of the building as a school continued through the nineteenth century and between 1816 and 1830 around �70 was spent on repairs to the building (Manchee 1831, 226). By the time of the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXI.16.14) surveyed in 1881-82 an extension had been added to the northern half of the north-east end of the building. The building was extant at the time of the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan published in 1903 (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXI.16). However by the time of the third edition plan published in 1918 it had been demolished.\r\nRoyal Fort Road was subsequently widened and the site of the school now lies partly beneath the northern side of the road and partly within the site of the Children's Hospital."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
