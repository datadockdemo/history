<http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/resource/monument_record_no/1042M> <https://schema.org/description> "The Portwall, a town wall enclosing the suburb or Redcliff and the Temple Fee to the south-east of Temple Church. The wall was constructed in the thirteenth century and ran from a terminal tower, Tower Harratz (BUAD 671M), at Temple Back across Temple Meads and along Portwall Lane to Redcliff Back. There were a number of interval towers or bastions along the length of the wall, and there was a water gate (BUAD 1418M), close to Tower Harratz. The wall was also pierced by gates for vehicular traffic at the southern ends of Temple Street (Temple Gate - BUAD 927M) and Redcliff Street (Redcliff Gate - BUAD 1211M).\r\nThe wall has been recorded during archaeological excavation in several locations. It was constructed in Pennant sandstone bonded in a light-brown sandy mortar and measured 2 metres wide. Its foundations extended several metres into the underlying alluvial clay but none of the excavations has so far found any evidence for supporting piles. In front of the wall was a berm which was approximately 15 metres wide. Beyond this was a substantial ditch, known as Portwall ditch which was around 15 metres wide and up to 5 metres deep (BUAD 312; 408).\r\nThe wall was altered and reinforced during the English Civil Wars of the 1640s and the excavations of the Portwall ditch (BUAD 312; 408) also found evidence for recutting of the ditch, probably associated with the refortification of the wall during the 1640s. A survey of 1643 records cannon at Tower Harratz, Temple Gate and the adjacent tower and at Redcliff Gate (Roy 1975, 261-263). Assaults were made on the Portwall by Royalist forces in 1643 and by the New Model Army in 1645. The wall was not breached and after the wars appears to have remained largely extant - it was recorded by James Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol - and the reputation of its strength was a causal factor in encouraging the Monmouth rebels not to attack the south side of Bristol in the mid-1680s.\r\nThe Portwall appears to have remained standing into the post-medieval period and been gradually incorporated into other structures. No part of the wall now survives above ground but it is known to be extant for considerable stretches along its length. During excavation and evaluation in several places the wall has been located close to the ground surface. The eastern half of the Portwall was retained in situ in the Temple Quay development and a scheme of paving and lighting to mark its line was designed by the Irish artist John Aiken."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadockdemo/history/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
